<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a production-grade SAAS platform for healthcare professionals, similar to topmate.io.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Main Domain:** A primary website () with sections like Our Experts, Video Consultation, Join as Expert, and Customize for You.
- **Automatic Subdomains:** Each approved expert gets a personalized landing page (e.g., ) with their professional info, social links, videos, testimonials, and scheduling system.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A secure dashboard for admins to manage professionals, view business reports, create/edit landing pages, and see analytics.
- **Core Funnel:** A multi-step process for patients: Appointment Scheduling -> Personal Info -> Payment -> Meeting Scheduled.
- **Integrations:** Razorpay for split payments (10% platform fee), Google Meet for automatic meeting scheduling, and WhatsApp Business API for notifications.
- **Onboarding:** An admin form to onboard new experts, collecting extensive details (profile photo, videos, qualifications, availability, bank details, theme color, etc.) to automatically generate their landing page.
- **Technology Stack Change:** The user initially started with a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack but later requested a complete migration to a **Core PHP backend** and **MySQL database**, compatible with Hostinger hosting.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is in a broken, half-migrated state.
- A **React frontend** exists with many components and pages already built.
- The original **FastAPI backend has been deleted**.
- A new **Core PHP backend** has been created in the  directory. The PHP files are written to use MongoDB for now, as a temporary measure since a MySQL server could not be installed.
- A  file exists for the eventual migration to MySQL.
- The React frontend is **not yet connected** to the new PHP backend.
- The server environment is not configured to run the PHP backend; supervisor is likely still configured for the old Python server. The application is currently non-functional.
- Multiple documentation files (, migration guides) were created to reflect the new PHP/MySQL stack.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was performing a major technology stack migration from FastAPI/Python to Core PHP. It had just finished creating all the necessary PHP files for the backend, creating a MySQL schema file, cleaning up old Laravel/Python files, and updating documentation. The agent attempted to start the PHP server but failed due to environment constraints (port in use, command timeout).
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** backend testing agent. The first step is to get the PHP server running. Use  to test basic PHP endpoint connectivity once the server is configured. Afterward, a full run of the backend testing agent is needed to validate all API endpoints.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1 (P0):** Application is non-functional after tech stack migration.
- **Issue 2 (P1):** Database mismatch between temporary implementation (MongoDB) and final goal (MySQL).
- **Issue 3 (P2):** The View Profile button navigation was fixed for the old stack but needs re-verification with the new PHP backend.

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:** The application is broken. The frontend cannot communicate with a backend because the original Python backend was deleted, and the new PHP backend was never successfully started or configured to be served by Apache.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent tried to start a PHP development server using , which failed due to port conflicts and timeouts. This is not the correct approach in this environment.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify Apache2 is running ().
        2.  Create an Apache virtual host configuration file in  to point to  as the document root.
        3.  Enable the new site with  and disable the default site.
        4.  Modify the main  file if needed to correctly route requests to .
        5.  Restart Apache: .
        6.  Update supervisor configuration () to stop managing the (now deleted) Python backend and ensure it doesn't conflict with Apache.
        7.  Test a PHP endpoint with  (a new simple test file may be needed).
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the highest priority. Fixing this will make the application functional again by allowing the frontend to communicate with the new backend.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend first, then both.
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the primary blocker.

- **Issue 2:** The PHP backend was written to connect to the existing MongoDB instance as a temporary measure, but the user's requirement is a MySQL database.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent created a  file and a  guide.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  After stabilizing the PHP backend (Issue 1), confirm with the user if they want to proceed with the MySQL migration immediately.
        2.  If yes, attempt to install a MySQL-compatible database like .
        3.  Execute the  script to create the tables.
        4.  Update the PHP database connection file () to use MySQL credentials.
        5.  Update all PHP models/data access logic to use MySQLi or PDO instead of the MongoDB driver.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill the user's core technology stack requirement.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend.
    - **Blocked on other issue:** Issue 1.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1 (P0):** Complete the Backend Migration to Core PHP & MySQL.
- **Task 2 (P1):** Implement the enhanced Admin Panel Onboarding Form.

**Task Detail:**
- **Task 1:** Complete the Backend Migration to Core PHP & MySQL.
    - **Where to resume:** The PHP files are created but not running. The next step is to configure the server environment (Apache) to serve the PHP backend, as detailed in Issue 1. After that, connect the frontend to the new PHP endpoints.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional application running on the user's desired PHP/MySQL stack.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** The immediate task is blocked on server configuration.

- **Task 2:** Implement the enhanced Admin Panel Onboarding Form.
    - **Where to resume:** This task was interrupted by the tech stack migration request. None of the detailed admin form fields (e.g., file uploads, color picker, bank details) have been implemented on the backend or frontend. Work needs to start from scratch on the new PHP/React stack.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** A key feature allowing admins to easily create and manage expert landing pages, which is central to the business model.
    - **Status:** NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** Task 1. The application stack must be stable before adding new features.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - (P1) **Admin Panel Analytics:** Implement platform-wide and doctor-specific analytics (Appointments, Revenue, Patients Info).
    - (P1) **Background Functionalities:** Implement and test background processes like Google Meet scheduling, WhatsApp notifications, and the full Razorpay payment flow (currently mocked).
    - (P2) **Admin Landing Page Management:** Add functionality for the admin to modify and enhance landing pages after they are created.

**Completed work in this session**
- Built an initial version of the SAAS platform using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.
- Implemented a main landing page, expert joining form, and basic admin/doctor pages.
- Added 3 sample doctors and improved the homepage UI based on user feedback.
- Fixed an initial navigation issue with the View Profile button.
- **Pivoted the entire backend from FastAPI/Python to Core PHP**, creating all new PHP files for APIs, services, and configuration.
- Created a MySQL database schema ().
- Created extensive documentation, including , , and a guide for migrating from MongoDB to MySQL.
- Cleaned the repository by removing the old FastAPI and temporary Laravel files.

- **Recently completed:**
  - Core PHP backend file creation (DONE)
  - Documentation update for PHP stack (DONE)
  - Repository cleanup of old backends (DONE)

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The extensive list of Admin Panel features requested by the user in message #102 was started (View Profile button fix) but then abandoned due to the tech stack change request. This includes the entire admin onboarding form, detailed analytics, and landing page management.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Core PHP (intended to replace FastAPI)
- **Database:** MongoDB (currently), with a pending migration to MySQL.
- **Architecture:** The plan is a standard API-driven architecture with a React single-page application consuming a stateless PHP backend.

**key DB schema**
A  file exists but is not yet implemented. The schema defines tables for  (admins), , , , and .

**changes in tech stack**
- Complete backend migration from **FastAPI (Python)** to **Core PHP**.
- Planned database migration from **MongoDB** to **MySQL**.

**All files of reference**
- : The entire new Core PHP backend.
- : The existing React frontend.
- : The target schema for the MySQL database.
- : Guide for the pending database migration.
- : Directory for Apache configuration, which needs to be modified to serve the PHP backend.
- : Supervisor config that needs to be updated to remove the old Python service.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The project is in a critical, non-working state due to an incomplete tech stack migration. Your first priority is **stabilization**. Do not add new features until the PHP backend is running correctly and the frontend is connected to it. The user has driven these major architectural changes, so clear communication about the current state and the plan to fix it is essential. The agent correctly installed Apache, but failed to configure it or use it, instead trying to use PHP's built-in server which is not suitable for this environment. Focus on configuring Apache to serve the  directory.
